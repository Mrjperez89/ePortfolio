# Justin Perez's ePortfolio

## Overview
Welcome to my ePortfolio, which showcases my journey and accomplishments as a Computer Science student at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). This ePortfolio highlights the artifacts that demonstrate my skills and growth in three key categories:
1. **Software Design and Engineering**
2. **Algorithms and Data Structures**
3. **Databases**

Each artifact in this portfolio has been enhanced to reflect my understanding and mastery of key computer science principles. Additionally, I have included narratives detailing the process, challenges, and decisions made during the enhancement of these artifacts. These enhancements were informed by the principles and best practices learned throughout the program, ensuring that each artifact showcases my ability to design, develop, and secure high-quality software.

## Artifacts

### 1. Secure Authentication System (CS 405: Secure Coding)
- **Category**: Software Design and Engineering
- **Description**: This artifact involved creating a secure authentication system emphasizing the importance of protecting user credentials. The system incorporates advanced security features such as password hashing, input validation, and two-factor authentication (2FA).
- **Enhancements**:
  - Implementation of SHA-256 hashing with salts to securely store passwords.
  - Integration of 2FA for additional security layers.
  - Improved input validation to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
- **Significance**: This project demonstrates my ability to design secure and scalable systems, incorporating best practices to safeguard sensitive data.

### 2. Reverse Engineering Software (CS 410: Reverse Software Engineering)
- **Category**: Algorithms and Data Structures
- **Description**: This artifact involved analyzing compiled software to identify vulnerabilities, improve performance, and secure the system against potential exploits. The reverse engineering process required the use of advanced tools and critical thinking to understand and refactor the decompiled code.
