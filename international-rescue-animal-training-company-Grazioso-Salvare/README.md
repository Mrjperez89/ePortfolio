1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs involves adhering to best practices such as modularization, clear naming conventions, and documentation. The CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Python module developed for Project One facilitated seamless integration between our dashboard and MongoDB in Project Two. The module promoted code reusability and reduced redundancy by encapsulating database operations in reusable functions. This modular approach enhanced maintainability, as updates or modifications to database interactions could be made centrally, reflecting across the application.
Looking ahead, the potential of the CRUD module is boundless. It could be extended for various applications beyond the current dashboard project. Imagine it supporting backend operations for web applications, data analysis pipelines, or automated reporting systems. Its versatility lies in its ability to abstract database complexities, providing a clean interface for developers to interact with MongoDB without directly handling low-level database operations. The future is bright for this module, and the possibilities are endless.

3. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet different client requests?

  As a computer scientist, I approach problems through systematic analysis, planning, and execution. For Grazioso Salvare's dashboard requirements, I began by understanding the project scope, defining clear objectives, and aligning technical solutions with client needs. Unlike previous assignments focused solely on theoretical concepts, this project required practical implementation, emphasizing real-world application and integration across technology stacks.
In the future, when creating databases to meet client requests, I would employ agile methodologies for iterative development, ensuring continuous feedback loops and adapting to evolving requirements. Techniques such as user story mapping, prototyping, and incremental deployment would be instrumental in delivering databases that meet functional specifications and align closely with user expectations and business goals.
