## About Me
I am on track to complete my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering in December 2024. With a background in retail management, I transitioned into computer science to pursue my passion for technology and problem-solving. My focus areas include secure software development and reverse engineering, with the goal of building reliable, scalable applications. Over the course of my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in the software development life cycle, data structures, and algorithms. These skills align with my career aspirations in software engineering, where I aim to specialize in creating secure, high-quality software solutions.
